Start up backend

Intizilaze app
fluter run


Note: Since you're running the backend locally, you'll need to adjust the baseUrl in api_service.dart based on your setup:
For Android emulator, use: http://10.0.2.2:8080
For iOS simulator, use: http://localhost:8080
For physical devices, use your computer's local IP address
use: http://IPadress:8080
